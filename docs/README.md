# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

This README provides a high-level overview of OctoAcme's project management processes and direct links to all individual process docs for easy onboarding and navigation.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme’s project management processes are anchored in clear principles, role definition, and repeatable workflows that support cross-functional delivery of product features, services, and integrations. Project initiation begins with validating business needs, aligning stakeholders, and defining success criteria through concise artifacts like the Project One-pager. This one-pager captures the problem statement, goals, success metrics, stakeholders, timeline, and key risks, setting a foundation for transparent project authorization and planning.

Core project roles include the Project Manager—who coordinates schedules, risks, and communications; the Product Manager—focused on defining outcomes and backlog prioritization; Developers—responsible for feature implementation and testing; QA specialists—validating quality and acceptance criteria; and Stakeholders—providing direction and approvals. Each role has distinct responsibilities, supported by structured templates for planning, backlog management, risk registers, and retrospectives, helping maintain clear ownership and accountability throughout the project lifecycle.

Execution and tracking employ agile best practices, with daily standups to address progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs, and regular sprint demos. The team uses project boards tracking status from backlog to done and follows strict pull request conventions—maintaining small PR size, automated CI for tests and linting, and required reviews prior to merge. Quality assurance involves layered testing strategies: unit and integration tests for code, end-to-end smoke tests for releases, CI-driven security scans, and manual QA where appropriate, ensuring robust validation before deployment.

Communication is rhythmic and purposeful: weekly PM/Product Manager syncs, monthly stakeholder updates, and escalation protocols for blockers or incidents. Process artifacts and status updates are shared via README or dedicated documentation, supporting transparency and enabling rapid onboarding. Continuous improvement is woven into retrospectives following each milestone, where learnings are converted into actionable items that are tracked and revisited, facilitating incremental process enhancement and a culture of ongoing feedback.
